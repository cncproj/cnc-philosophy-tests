safe position command: G53G00G90Z0.;G53G90X0.Y0.

if candle does not restore previous origin, 

    [1] write down machine coordinates when setting previous work datums. 
    [2] always move back to safe machine position at 0,0,0 before power down.
    [3] when re-opened candle, check whether coordinates match. 
        if not, 
            [2.1] zero the work coordinates. 
            [2.2] type "g00 g54 X<work-x-zero> Y<work-y-zero>" and press arrow key.
            [2.3] type "g00 g54 z<work-z-zero>" and press arrow key. 
            [2.4] now it is at work origin. zero the work coordinates again


notes: 

  M3  ---spindle on.
  M5  ---spindle off.
  M2  ---program end. stop machine.
  M30 ---same as M2

  G53  ---cancel any G54/G55/G56/G57/G58/G59
  G21  ---unit mm
  G90  ---absolute coordinates
  G28.1 ---set work origin.
  G28   ---go to work origin.

  G40   ---cutter compensation off. grbl does not support this.
  G49   ---cancel tool length offset.
  G80   ---cancel canned cycle. grbl does not support this.
